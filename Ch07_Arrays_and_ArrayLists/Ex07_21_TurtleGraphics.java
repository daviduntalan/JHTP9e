 * Turtle Graphics. The Logo language made the concept of turtle 
 * graphics famous. Imagine a mechanical turtle that walks around the 
 * room under the control of a Java application. The turtle holds a pen 
 * in one of two positions, up or down. While the pen is down, the 
 * turtle traces out shapes as it moves, and while the pen is up, the 
 * turtle moves about freely without writing anything. In this problem, 
 * youâ€™ll simulate the operation of the turtle and create a 
 * computerized sketchpad.
