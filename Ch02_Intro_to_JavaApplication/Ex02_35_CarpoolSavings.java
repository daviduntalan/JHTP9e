/**
 * Car-Pool Savings Calculator. 
 * Research several car-pooling websites. 
 * 
 * Create an application that calculates your daily driving cost,
 * so that you can estimate how much money could be saved by 
 * car pooling, which also has other advantages such as reducing
 * carbon emissions and reducing traffic congestion.
 * 
 * The application should input the following information and
 * display the user's cost per day of driving to work:
 * 
 * a.) Total miles driven per day.
 * b.) Cost per gallon of gasoline.
 * c.) Average miles per gallon.
 * d.) Parking fees per day.
 * e.) Tolls per day.
